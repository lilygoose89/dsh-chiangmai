 	<h3>This workshop is for you if:</h3>
 	<ul>
 		<li>You have already started your pitch deck, but you don&rsquo;t know who to send it to.</li>
 		<li>The pitch seems good on paper, but you&rsquo;re not confident when presenting it.</li>
 		<li>Investors are intrigued by your idea, but don&rsquo;t seem to *get it* yet.</li>
 		<li>Your company is ready to grow and scale with the right support.</li>
 	</ul>
 	<h3>This workshop is <em>not</em> for you if:</h3>
 	<ul>
 		<li>You&rsquo;ve just started and you&rsquo;re not sure yet what funding you need.</li>
 		<li>Your idea or IP cannot be shared openly without an NDA.</li>
 		<li>You just want to make a good presentation for the sake of an award.</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p><strong>THIS WORKSHOP IS DESIGNED TO GET YOU ON THE PATH TO FUNDRAISING</strong></p>
 	<p><em>Suitable for all funding stages.</em></p>
 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
 	<h2>Agenda</h2>
 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
 	<h4>Day 1: Perfect Your Slide Deck</h4>
 	<ul>
 		<li>What makes a good slide deck?</li>
 		<li>What convinces an investor to take a meeting?</li>
 		<li>How do you tell a good story?</li>
 		<li>Which order is the most compelling and what slides do you actually need?</li>
 		<li>How does good design help you make your argument?</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>Along with guidance from mentors, you will discuss and share ideas with your fellow startups on how to improve and perfect your pitch deck.&nbsp;</p>
 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
 	<h4>Day 2: Nail Your Elevator Pitch</h4>
 	<ul>
 		<li>How do you explain your startup in less than 3 minutes?</li>
 		<li>What are common questions people have for you and what&rsquo;s confusing about your pitch?</li>
 		<li>What is essential to your business and what&rsquo;s fluff?</li>
 		<li>Exactly how much information do you share to start, and what do you save for behind closed doors?</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>This is the day to practice your presentation skills. Founders will each get a turn to pitch in front of the group to receive coaching and feedback. Elevator pitches will be revised, drilled and perfected so they become second-nature.</p>
 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
 	<h4>Beyond the pitch itself, we will also discuss:</h4>
 	<ul>
 		<li>How do you turn an elevator pitch into an opportunity to secure investment?</li>
 		<li>Where and how do you send your pitch deck to get investment?</li>
 		<li>What else do you need to learn before you&rsquo;re ready to get investment?</li>
 	</ul>
 	<p>&nbsp;</p>
